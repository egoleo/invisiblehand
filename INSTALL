Requirements:
-------------

Before you begin, you should ensure that you have the following:
1. Sane system with default toolchain (sed, etc.) (*)
2. GNU make
3. drush
4. drush-site-install6
5. mysql client-side tools (**)

(*) It may be the case that a few things break on non-Debian systems. That is
not intentional and I'd be happy if you can inform me about what broke and the
system you are using so that I can fix it. Or better yet, you could fix it
yourself and let me git pull in your changes.

(**) Because of a current requirement, I'm only working on MySQL support for
now. But in the near future I'd like to support PostgreSQL as well. As always,
contributions are welcome.

Installation
------------

First:
% cp local.mk.default local.mk
% vi local.mk

Make whatever configuration changes you need to.

Now you might be able to:
% make install

or you may have to:
% su
<type root password>
# make install

it all depends on what access rights your user has to the destination 
directory.


HOW to Install DRUSH. This was done on a gentoo system but i hope
it works for most linux systems
...................................
wget http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drush-6.x-3.3.tar.gz
tar xvzf drush-6.x-3.3.tar.gz
sudo chmod 555 drush/drush
sudo chown -R root:root drush
sudo mv drush /usr/local/
sudo ln -s /usr/local/drush/drush /usr/local/bin/drush

ON GENTOO
ln -s /usr/local/drush/drush /usr/bin/drush
sudo drush dl drush_make 

you should see something like this for success
Project drush_make (6.x-2.0-beta9) downloaded to /root/.drush/drush_make.      [success]

Once drush is installed, u need to install the drush site install using the command below.

drush dl drush_site_install6
